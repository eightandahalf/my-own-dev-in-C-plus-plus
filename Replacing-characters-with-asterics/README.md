# Replacing characters with asterisks
With this program I try to process user input, that every user's action could have effects. Neither user press "Enter" key, "F1", or some numbers in a keyboard, 
I try to proccess every action. And if user press right keys to fill rows created to login and password, this data will display like asterics, that if, for example, 
that code would used in a ATM, people that stay around of actual client can't see his password or login in a display, that our client can feel safe while using our 
ATM or another stuff, where this code can be using.
